	Our protocol to be followed for completing the project will be to have a discussion at the start of each sprint, 
where we will split up a reasonable number of tasks to complete among the four of us. Looking at our burndown chart, 
we have approximately 230 hours of estimated work to complete in the span of 10 sprints. This means that we will each 
be completing at least 6 hours of estimated work in total, since we need to complete about 23 hours of work per sprint. 
For the tasks that exceed this amount (ie. one rated 8 or 16 hours), we will assign more than one person to the 
task during the sprint. Everything will be managed within Github, where we will create and work on documents within our 
own “develop” fork. Before committing our changes, we will discuss said updates as a group and gain everyone’s approval. 

  As far as the structure of the product itself proceeds, an HTML page and associated CSS page will make up the composition
of our stylized dashboard. The style of our dashboard will be based on a retro theme, as decided. Each game will be made
in their own separate page with additional CSS and Javascript pages, where each game’s page is activated as a result of
the user interacting with the dashboard. Every game will keep track of their respective high score, description, etc.
A login/create account page will also be created in order to grant dashboard and game access to those who have an account.
All account information will be kept track of with the use of cookies. Throughout development, we plan to try and keep
everything as separate and attempt to avoid dependency between different components such as the dashboard, accounts,
games themselves, etc.
